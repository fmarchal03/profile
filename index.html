    <div class="card">
      <p>I am a 20-year-old student eager to learn new things. I spent the last year in the Swiss Army where, due to my potential, I was encouraged to enroll in the NCO School and become a sergeant. This experience was enriching, teaching me numerous skills. Currently, I am in the process of applying to universities and preparing for the Web Development Bootcamp at Le Wagon.</p>
